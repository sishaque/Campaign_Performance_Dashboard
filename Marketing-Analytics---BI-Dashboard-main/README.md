## Summary of actionable findings
- The most successful advertising campaign was the most recent campaign (column name: Response), and was particularly successful in Mexico (>60% acceptance rate!)
Suggested action: Conduct future advertising campaigns using the same model recently implemented in Mexico.
- The best-performing channels are web and store purchases (i.e. the average customer made the most purchases via these channels)
Suggested action: Focus advertising campaigns on the more successful channels, to reach more customers
- Advertising campaign acceptance is positively correlated with income and negatively correlated with having kids/teens
Suggested action: Create two streams of targeted advertising campaigns, one aimed at high-income individuals without kids/teens and another aimed at lower-income individuals with kids/teens
- The most successful products are wines and meats (i.e. the average customer spent the most on these items)
Suggested action: Focus advertising campaigns on boosting sales of the less popular items
